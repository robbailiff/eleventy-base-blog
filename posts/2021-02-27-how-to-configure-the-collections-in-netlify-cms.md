Using the Netlify CMs for the first time was very confusing. I didn't really know what I was doing and I basically just copied the code from the setup tutorial and hoped it work. In particular, I had no idea how the CMS worked, what it was actually doing or how to change the template in the CMS to match the pre-existing posts format.
